Build errors
============

In this guide, you will find information on how to troubleshoot local or GitHub PR build errors that may occur when building a documentation set.

'Module not found' error
------------------------

The build fails with a ``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '<module>'`` error message when you run it locally (or in a GitHub PR check).

Probable cause
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ``ModuleNotFoundError`` means the Python interpreter running the build cannot locate the named module at all. The most common causes for a local build are:

* **The package is missing from** ``requirements.txt``. The module is not installed because it is not declared as a dependency. If it works for you but fails for a colleague or in CI, it is likely installed in your environment but absent from ``requirements.txt``.
* **A local module or extension is not on** ``sys.path``. Custom extensions or ``conf.py`` helpers that live inside the repository are not importable unless their directory is added to the path in ``conf.py``.

Resolution
~~~~~~~~~~

Read the full traceback and note the exact module name reported after ``No module named`` error message. If it is a third-party package (for example ``myst-parser``), check whether it is listed in ``requirements.txt``. If it is missing, add it and reinstall. If it is present, confirm it is actually installed in the active environment with ``pip show <package>``. If a newer version is available, consider updating it and adjusting the version constraints in ``requirements.txt`` accordingly.

Rebuild to confirm the fix

.. code-block:: bash

     make clean; make run

.. tip::

   If the build works for you but fails for a colleague or in a GitHub PR check, the module is almost always installed in your local environment but missing from ``requirements.txt``. Add it there so every environment installs it.

For local extensions, you need to append the source to your system path by adding the following line to your ``conf.py`` file:

.. code-block:: python  

     sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('<path>'))  

'Pip resolution too deep' error
--------------------------------

This error occurred recently while building several Sphinx Stack based documentation sets independently on different machines on a specific day when a new version of ``myst-parser`` was released. The issue could be resolved by pinning the ``myst-parser`` version in the ``requirements.txt`` file.

Probable cause
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This error may occur when the ``requirements.txt`` file has conflicting dependencies or a dependency tree is too complex for ``pip`` to resolve efficiently.

Documentation based on the Sphinx Stack often hit this error due to an unpinned or incompatible version of a package.

Resolution
~~~~~~~~~~

Review the dependencies listed in the ``requirements.txt`` file and resolve any conflicts caused by incompatible or unpinned package versions or newly released versions. 

To fix the issue, try:

* Restricting problem packages to recent versions (using ``package~=version``)
* Using a constraints file

Sporadic "No such file or directory" errors
-------------------------------------------

If your Read the Docs builds are sporadically failing due to a file missing error,
first check the build output to make sure the issue isn't related to dependencies.

Once you have verified this is not the case, double check your ``conf.py`` configuration.

Probable cause
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``sphinx-llm`` extension by default creates a parallel process that touches build files while the main process
(or other extensions, like ``sphinx-tags``) could still be using them. This can cause the missing
file error.

Resolution
~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::
   Note that this workaround can cause your build times to grow, as the parallel nature of the normal config cuts build times considerably.

To fix this, tell ``sphinx-llm`` in your ``conf.py`` to not build in parallel:

.. code-block:: python

   # Run sphinx-llm markdown generation sequentially to prevent race conditions
   llms_txt_build_parallel = False
