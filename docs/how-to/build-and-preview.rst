Build and preview
=================

The Sphinx Stack provides a ``Makefile`` that defines ``make`` commands to build and
view the documentation.

This guide describes how to set up your environment and use these commands to build and
preview the documentation locally.

For more advanced information, including how to embed your docs build with your project
build, see:

- :ref:`build`
- :ref:`bridge-project-and-docs-builds`


Install prerequisite software
-----------------------------

The documentation framework that the Sphinx Stack uses bundles most prerequisites in a
Python virtual environment, so you don't need to worry about installing them. There are
only a few packages that you need to install on your host system.

Before you start, make sure that you have ``make``, ``python3``, ``python3-venv``, and
``python3-pip`` on your system:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install make python3 python3-venv python3-pip


Python environment
------------------

The Python prerequisites from the ``docs/requirements.txt`` file are automatically
installed when you build the documentation.

If you want to install them manually, you can run the following command in your
documentation directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    make install

This command creates a virtual environment (``.venv/``) and installs dependency
software within it.

If you want to remove the installed Python packages (for example, to enforce a
re-installation), run the following command in your documentation directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    make clean

.. note::

    - By default, the Sphinx Stack uses the latest compatible version of all tools and
      does not pin its requirements. This might change temporarily if there is an
      incompatibility with a new tool version. There is therefore no need to use a tool
      like Renovate to automatically update the requirements.
    - If you encounter the error ``locale.Error: unsupported locale setting`` when
      activating the Python virtual environment, include the environment variable in the
      command and try again: ``LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 make run``


.. important::

    Run these commands in your documentation directory.


.. _build-docs:

Build the documentation
-----------------------

To build the documentation, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    make html

This command installs the required tools and renders the output to the ``docs/_build/``
directory.

.. important::

    When you run ``make html`` again, it updates the documentation for changed files
    only.

    This speeds up the build, but it can cause you to miss warnings or errors that were
    displayed before. To force a clean build, see ``build-clean``.

Make sure that the documentation builds without any warnings (warnings are treated as
errors).


.. _build-clean:

Run a clean build
-----------------

To delete all existing output files and build all files again, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    make clean-doc && make html

To delete both the existing output files and the Python environment and build the full
documentation again, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    make clean && make html


View the documentation
----------------------

To view the documentation output, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    make serve

This command builds the documentation and serves it at
:literalref:`http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.


Live view
---------

Instead of building the documentation for each change and then serving it, you can run a
live preview of the documentation:

.. code-block:: bash

    make run

This command builds the documentation and serves it at
:literalref:`http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. When you change a documentation file and save it,
the documentation will be automatically rebuilt and refreshed in the browser.

If you need project-specific options for ``sphinx-autobuild`` such as ``--ignore`` or
``--watch``, pass them through ``SPHINX_AUTOBUILD_OPTS``:

.. code-block:: bash

    make run SPHINX_AUTOBUILD_OPTS="--ignore '**/*.gen.rst' --watch ../data/"

If you call ``make run`` from a :ref:`parent project's build
<bridge-project-and-docs-builds>`, pass the variable explicitly to the sub-Make call to
ensure it reaches the docs Makefile:

.. code-block:: bash

    $(MAKE) -C docs run SPHINX_AUTOBUILD_OPTS="$(SPHINX_AUTOBUILD_OPTS)"

This approach allows command-line overrides to work intuitively from the parent context.

.. important::

    The ``run`` target is very convenient while working on documentation updates.

    However, it is quite error-prone because it displays warnings or errors only when
    they occur. If you save other files later, you might miss these messages.

    Therefore, you should always run ``make clean`` before finalizing your changes.


Build a PDF
-----------

Build a PDF locally with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    make pdf

PDF generation requires specific software packages. If these files are not found, a
prompt will be presented and the generation will stop.

Required software packages include:

* dvipng
* fonts-freefont-otf
* latexmk
* plantuml
* tex-gyre
* texlive-font-utils
* texlive-fonts-recommended
* texlive-lang-cjk
* texlive-latex-extra
* texlive-latex-recommended
* texlive-xetex
* xindy

On Linux, required packages can be installed with:

.. code-block:: none

    make pdf-prep-force
    
.. note::

    When generating a PDF, the index page is considered a 'foreword' and will not be
    labelled with a chapter.

.. important::

    When generating a PDF, it is important to not use additional headings before a
    ``toctree``. Documents referenced by the ``toctree`` will be nested under any
    provided headings.

    A ``rubric`` directive can be combined with the ``h2`` class to provide a
    heading-styled rubric in the HTML output. See the default ``index.rst`` for an
    example. Rubric-based headings aren't included as entries in the table of contents
    or the navigation sidebar.
